### Enrolling
To start enrolling, you can look for courses in the dashboard or in the search screen. 
If it's free, and it's on the default subscription, you can enroll right away.

Once you subscribe to a course, you can look into it:


<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="../assets/img/courseDetail.png" width="40%" ></div>

Here you can see a bunch of options.
The most important one: Content. You will see a list of all the chapters, and inside each chapter there can be a lot of videos,
you can switch chapters with the arrows (as shown in the image above).

Inside the same view, you have more options, such as looking at the collaborators of the course, 
see the reviews of the course, see the other students of the course, see the exams or send a direct message to the creator.

## Exams

Each course can have as many exams as the creator wants, and each exam has a date, a start time and a duration,
meaning you have limited time to complete the exam.

* Note: If you're enrolled in a course and an exam is about to start it will send you a push notification 
* letting you know that the exam is about to start.

You can see al the exams listed as it shows below:

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="../assets/img/examList.png" width="40%" ></div>

If the exam is happening right now you can complete it: You will have a combination of free answer questions
and multiple choice. Once you have finished, you can send your answers.

## Messages

There are a lot of ways to contact users inside a course: you can send them a direct message and they will
get a pop up letting them know you're talking to them. Same way if someone is talking to you... These messages are in real time!
