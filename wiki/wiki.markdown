### First step
First of all, you must sign up as a creator or student.
You can either sign up with email and password or with an existing Google account.

* Note: To use the app you must be 18+ years old. The app includes payments.

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="../assets/img/register.png" width="40%" ></div>


Once you've registered in the app you can login (either by email and password or with google).

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="../assets/img/login.png" width="40%" ></div>


One important thing to notice is that when you are registered in the app, it'll automatically create a wallet 
address and a default subscription.
