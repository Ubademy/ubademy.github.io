# Using the platform as student

* Then you're inside the app! Right now you're in the dashboard, if you're a student you'll see all the courses that are in the platform based on your country. If you are a creator, you'll see all of your created courses.

* You'll also see in the bottom tab another icons. Those will redirect you to another views, such as _Courses search_, _Notifications_, _Private messages_ and _Profile_.

One important thing to notice is that when you are registered in the app, it'll automatically create a wallet address and a default subscription.

## Subscriptions:

You can have one of these subscriptions:

* Default: This is the default subscription. It is free! You can join courses with default subscription.

* Ubademy+:
This is the second tier subscription. You get access to courses with ubademy+ subscription and get 20% discount on default courses.

* Ubademy Pass:
This is the first tier subscription. You get access to all courses and you get 20% discount on ubademy+ courses and 50% discount on default courses.

You can see in the Profile view an icon showing the information for each of the subscriptions, and the prices.

## To start enrroling in courses, you can find either in the dashboard or in the search courses screen the courses that you want. If it's free and it's on the default subscription, you can enroll right away.

Once inside a course subscripted, this is what you'll see:

Here you can see a bunch of options. The most important one: If the course has content, it will show up a list of all the chapters, and inside each chapter it can be a lot of videos, you can switch between them with the arrows (as shown in the image above).

Inside the same view, you have more options, such as looking at the collaborators of the course, see the reviews of the course, see the other students of the course, see the exams or send a direct message to the creator.

## Exams

Each course can have as many exams as the creator wants, and each exam has a date, a start time and a duration, meaning that you have only one lapse of time to complete the exam.

* Note: If you're enrrolled to a course and an exam is about to start it will send you a push notification letting you know that the exam is about to start.

You can see al the exams listed as it shows below:

If the exam is happening right now you can complete it: You will have a combination of free answer questions and multiple choice. Once you finished, if the time is not up you can send the response.

## Messages

There are a lot of ways to contacting different users inside a course, you can send them a direct message and they will recieve a pop up letting them know you're talking to them. Same way if someone is talking to you, and inside the view it's in real time!

# Creator

When you have a course created, you can either edit it (common info), you can add content.

This works as: You have to add a title, a description, either an URL from a youtube video or an image and the chapter and the order. The first one is chapter 1, order: 1.

* Important: The chapters and the order must be sequential.

You can also create an exam, and you should provide the date where it's happening, the start time and the duration and add as many questions as you want, where you can say if the question is free answer, or a multiple choice with 4 options.

![logo](assets/img/createExam.png){:class="img-responsive"}

* Note: For creating an exam, you must have at least 2 questions.

Inside an exam, you can see the response of the different users enrolled in the course, and once you see the exam you can put the grade that you want, between 1 and 10.

If the exam is finished, the user will recieve a notification that the exam was graded.
